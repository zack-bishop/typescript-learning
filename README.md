# TypeScript Learning: Zack's Notes

##  Section 1: Getting Started.
### 1.1 Welcome to the Course
* brief introduction

### 1.2 What is TypeScript & Why Should You Use It?

* TypeScript = A JavaScript Superset 
* Browsers can’t execute it 
* Node.js can’t execute it 
* Tpescript compiles to JavaScript. 
* One big advantage of TypeScript: It adds types. 
* Basically, TypeScript gives you some new features / cleaner syntax that then gets compiled into mess / difficult / complex JS

### 1.3 Join Our Learning Community
* just an announcement to join their discord

### 1.4 Installing & Using TypeScript

* Shows an example.  
* With Vanilla JS, anytime you get `.value`, it’s always a string.
* `npm install typescript` install it globally.
* **Ran into some issues getting typescript installed, had to update node and npm and all that stuff**
  * **Updated node / npm**
  * **TS only works on node v12?**
  * **Tested projects just to make sure I didn't bork them.  We're good.**
* `tsc --version` Check it's version.  `tsc` is what you use to invoke TS commands
* installed TS extensions into PHPStorm. 
* `const num1 = document.getElementById("num1")!` <-- the `!` at the end tells TS that it will always find an element with that ID.
* `const numb2 = document.getElementById("num1")! as HTMLInputElement;` <-- Type casting.  oooo!
* `function add(num1: number, num2: number)` <-- Type casting on function params.  oooo!
* `tsc zack-ts.js` <-- compiles the TS
  * will log errors in terminal, but still compiles if error encountered.
* ` console.log(add(+input1.value, +input2.value));` <-- `+` converts the values to numbers?  
  * Don't think this is specific to TS, but is a JS thing.

### 1.5 Overview
* TypeScript = Makes writing clean, good code easier
* Main claim to fame is typecasting, hence the name
* You can use next-gen JavaScript, but compiles for older browser.  Kinda like Babel
* Includes Non-JS features, like interfaces or Generics <-- I feel like I sorta know what these are, look into more down the road.
* Meta-programming features like Decorations <-- no idea what these are.
* Rich Configuration Options <-- You can configure the compiler in a lot of ways.  Interesting.  Never really done anything like that before.

### 1.6 Course Outline
* Getting Started <-- In progress
* TypeScript Basics
* Compiler + Configuration
* Working with Next-Gen JS Code
* Classes & Interfaces
* Advanced Types & TypeScript Features
* Generics 
* Decorators
* Time to Practice - Full Project
* Namespaces & Modules
* Webpack & TypeScript
* Third-Party Libraries & TypeScript
* React + TypeScript & NodeJS + TyeScript 

### 1.7 How to Get the Most Out of the Course
* Just tips that were all common sense that don't necessitate notes.

### 1.8 Setting up a Code Editor / IDE
* Recommends using VScode.  Hard pass. Skipped.

### 1.9 Course Project.
* Basic setup of the Project we'll be working throughout the course.
* `npm init` <-- think this is the first I've run this before.
  * ran into an issue.  Couldn't run this because of my node version.  ran `nvm install v14`
* `npm install --save-dev lite-server` <-- `--save-dev` = dev only dependency
* `npm start` <-- created this command to run the `lite-server`
  * had to add the start command.
